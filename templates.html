            <p>
                A template is a pre-designed and structured document that serves as a foundation for creating specific categories of forms and workflow. It provides a framework with predefined fields, layouts, and formatting to streamline the process of gathering information. Templates are customizable, allowing users to adapt them to their unique needs by adding, removing, or modifying fields as necessary. These templates are particularly useful for ensuring consistency and efficiency in collecting data, as they offer a standardized format for various purposes such as surveys, feedback forms, or registration forms. Utilizing templates can save time, reduce errors, and enhance the overall user experience when interacting with the form and workflow.

            <p>You can use this feature in two ways: using pre-defined templates as a starting point or creating your own templates</p>
