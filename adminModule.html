            The admin module comprises features that are accessible to users with administrative privileges. Presently, the admin
            module encompasses dashboard management, role management, and user management. From the Admin module, it is possible to
            create roles and manage user roles.

            User Management
        </h3>
        <p>
            User creation can only be done using the Keycloak admin console. Once users are created, new roles or groups can be
            assigned to them from the Users tab. Additionally, if needed, the added roles can also be removed.
