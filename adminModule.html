            module encompasses dashboard management, role management, and user management. From the Admin module, it is possible to

        </h3>
        <p>
            User creation can only be done using the Keycloak admin console. Once users are created, new roles or groups can be
            assigned to them from Manage > Users. Additionally, if needed, the added roles can also be removed.
