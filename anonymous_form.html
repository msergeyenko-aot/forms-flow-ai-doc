                An anonymous form allows users to submit form entries anonymously. Users can access the
                form using the form URL without login to the application.

            </p>
            <p>Below steps describes how you can design a form anonymous.</p>


            <ol>
                <li>Create a new form or edit an already created form under Design > Forms.
                </li>

                <li>After you are satified with the layout and the flow, click on the "Settings" button in the top bar.</li>

                <li>In the Settings popup scroll down to "Who Can Create Submissions".

                </li>

                <li>Check or make sure "Anonymous users" checkbox is selected</li>
                <br><br>
                <strong> Do not forget to click "Save Changes"</strong>
                <br><br>
                <strong>Note-Forms will not be available to anonymous users if they are not published.</strong>
                <br><br>

                <li>Then you can share the URL to allow other users to submit anonymous forms by scrolling down and copying the form's "URL Path"
