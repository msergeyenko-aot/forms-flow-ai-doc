                <p>AOT Technologies initiated the formsflow.ai project to empower end users with the ability to access electronic forms, fill them online, submit them, and track their progress seamlessly. Additionally, service organizations benefit from a unified view of all requests, enabling them to review submissions efficiently and guide them through predefined workflows with ease.

                </p>
