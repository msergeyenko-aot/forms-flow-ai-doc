            <h1>Role Based Access Control for forms</h1>
            <hr><br>
            <p>formsflow introduces the ability for designers to set permissions for forms, catering to both designers
                and client
                users. This functionality provides fine-grained control over the visibility of forms based on user
                roles.</p>
            <p>
                With this feature, designers using formsflow can define specific permissions with each form they create.
                They have the
                flexibility to determine which roles can view and interact with a particular form. By configuring these
                permissions,
                designers can ensure that only authorized individuals or user roles can access and work with the form.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, this feature enhances the flexibility and control available to designers within formsflow,
                empowering them to
                manage permissions and determine who can interact with their forms. It ensures that the visibility of
                forms aligns with
                the assigned roles, creating a more secure and tailored environment for both designers and client users.

                            including the designer groups, client groups, and reviewer groups. The designer has to
                            choose the appropriate group.

                <li>
                    Publish and save the form for client users.

            </ol>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Note</strong> :<em>
                    If existing forms are to be listed for clients, you need to migrate the existing Camunda
                    authorizations. For this, you have to run a bash script inside the FormsFlow web API. If you need to
                    run this script in the instance or server, such as a Kubernetes cluster or Nginx, you have to access
                    the Docker container of the FormsFlow web API and execute the bash script called "migration.sh".
                    Alternatively, if you are setting up the environment locally and running the Docker container
                    locally, you can get inside the FormsFlow web API container and run the "migration.sh" command. In
                    the case of running the web API with Flask locally, you should activate the virtual environment and
                    run the bash script within it. You can create the virtual environment by following the instructions
                    provided in the Makefile inside the FormsFlow web API.
